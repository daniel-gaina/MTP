{\color{red}Question:} we talked about how to define sorts, but I do not remember because
we changed a couple of times. I think we said we should have a single sort keyword (\texttt{sort},
with the synonym \texttt{sorts} maybe) because the same sort might behave in one way for some
modules and in some other for other modules, do I remember correctly?

We have the following categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Spec, for a theory.

\item
ME, for module expressions.

\item
IE, for importation expressions.

\item
Decs, for the declarations in the theory.

\item
Id, for identifiers (tokens).

\item
IdL, for lists of identifiers (comma-separated tokens).

\item
SL, for lists of sorts (whitespace-separated tokens).

\item
AL, for lists of attributes.

\item
Att, for attributes.

\item
Params, for defining theory parameters.

\item
Imp, for importation declarations.

\item
Sort, for sort declarations.

\item
Subsort, for subsort declarations.

\item
Op, for operator declarations.

\item
Sen, for sentences.
\end{itemize}
